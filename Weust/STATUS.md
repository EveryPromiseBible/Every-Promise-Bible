# Wuest word-study commentary — status

## What this is

Original, verse-by-verse Greek word-study commentary, informed by Kenneth
Wuest's *Word Studies in the Greek New Testament* but **not** a reword or
paraphrase of his text. Wuest chose which Greek words in a verse are worth
stopping on — that selection is followed. The explanation of each word (what
it means, what its tense/case/mood implies, why it matters) is freshly
composed from those grammatical facts, in original sentences, with his own
prose and his citations of other scholars (Robertson, Vincent, Thayer,
Swete, etc.) set aside entirely and never quoted or closely paraphrased.

Each verse entry has two parts:
- **`text`** — the word-by-word commentary, one call-out per Greek word/
  phrase worth noting, in source-verse order.
- **`translation`** — a fresh, original, deliberately literal rendering of
  the verse that bakes the grammatical nuance (tense, mood, voice) directly
  into the English verb constructions rather than smoothing it into normal
  fluent prose — composed independently from the `text` field's grammatical
  facts, not from Wuest's own translation lines.

Wuest covered 16 books of the New Testament with this kind of running
commentary (the rest of his compilation is a separate vocabulary list and
several topical essay collections, out of scope here). This directory holds
one JSON file per finished book: `[{ "label": "Book C:V", "text": "...",
"translation": "..." }, ...]`, one entry per verse or small verse-range,
matching however Wuest himself grouped that discussion.

**Nothing of Wuest's own text is stored anywhere in this repo** — only the
original commentary and translations built from it.

The last 3 books were queued and hit a session/usage limit before producing
usable output — nothing was lost (they never got far enough to write real
files), they just need to be regenerated.

Every entry's `text` field already has a blank-line break inserted before
each sentence that introduces a new quoted word/phrase not yet discussed
in that entry — this splitting was retrofitted onto the first 10 books and
built in from the start for 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and 1 John; keep doing it
that way going forward.

## Next steps

1. Generate the remaining 3 books (2 John, 3 John, Jude) the same way
   as the rest — original commentary + literal translation per verse,
   matching the style in the finished books above.
2. Consolidate all 16 books, run a final QA pass (structure validation,
   spot-check a sample from every book, confirm nothing leaked from
   Wuest's actual prose or his citations of other scholars).
3. Design and build the site integration — most likely a tab in the
   Library alongside the translations, plus a "personal" row in the
   word-lookup popup that jumps straight to a tapped word's verse
   commentary when one exists (mirroring how Strong's/Thayer's/
   Abbott-Smith already work), falling back to a searchable index when it
   doesn't. Because this is original writing rather than reproduced text,
   none of the earlier passphrase/private-Worker/personal-only machinery
   is needed — it can just be a normal public feature.

Nothing here is wired into `index.html` yet. This directory is source
material only.
